# C wrapper for steam_api_flat.h functions

## WARNING: All of this is completely untested.
Please don't use it as of yet- it (probably) still needs refining.

The files are generated using `auto.py`, and the required library is `CppHeaderParser`.

Dependencies:
```
pip install CppHeaderParser
```

## AGAIN, EVERYTHING IS UNTESTED!! DONT USE YET
